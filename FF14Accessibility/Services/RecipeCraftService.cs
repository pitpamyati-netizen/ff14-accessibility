/// crafting log (/acc craftable) - the counterpart of the game's own
/// "herstellbar" line, which it computes for the SELECTED recipe only.
///
/// The list cannot be read off the window: the rows carry no mark for it (dump
/// 2026-09-11 - the only row-to-row difference is the crafted mark), and the
/// game has no filter for it either. So it is assembled from the game's own
/// data: <c>RecipeNote.RecipeList</c> holds every recipe of the open notebook
/// division with its ingredients, and <c>InventoryManager.GetInventoryItemCount</c>
/// says how much of an item the player carries (the call InventoryService
/// already uses - both qualities, since crafting accepts either).
///
/// Where the required items come from:
///   - the six material slots, from the RUNTIME entry (<see cref="RecipeNote.RecipeEntry.Ingredients"/>),
///     which is the same list the window shows;
///   - the two crystal slots, from the Recipe SHEET row that
///     <see cref="RecipeNote.RecipeEntry.RecipeId"/> points at. That join is the game's own,
///     not a guess: the ClientStructs doc of QuestManager.IsRecipeComplete names
///     the parameter "The RowId of the Recipe Sheet". The runtime struct is NOT
///     used for the crystals - it carries only an undocumented Id next to the
///     amount, and what that Id counts is not established (docs/game-api.md).
///
/// Every uncertainty counts as "not makeable": an item id that does not appear
/// among the sheet's material slots, a crystal slot outside the crystal item
/// range, an inventory that cannot be read. A false "you can make this" would
/// send a blind player to the crafting window for nothing, and they have no way
/// to see that the mod was wrong.
