// The one thing the gear comparison window shows that a blind player cannot get
// anywhere else: WHETHER THE PIECE IN THE BAG IS AN UPGRADE, and by how much in
// every single value.
//
// The game already answers that for a sighted player, and it answers it through
// LAYOUT AND COLOUR: two stat blocks printed side by side, with a difference next
// to each value of the selected one, green when it is up and red when it is down.
// A screen reader sees neither the columns nor the colours.
//
// This service rebuilds that window as a SPOKEN TABLE the player walks with the
// numpad (see BuildTable): the verdict is the title, and every value is one row
// carrying both sides - "Defence, 19, equipped 7, plus 12". The two columns of
// the game's window survive as the two halves of a row, which is the shape a
// screen reader can actually walk; a cursor that moves left and right between
// cells was considered and dropped, because it would have taken Numpad 4 and 6
// away from the back/confirm they mean in every other menu of this mod.
//
// THIS IS READ, NOT RECOMPUTED, and that distinction is the whole design. The
// obvious alternative was to look both items up in the Item sheet and subtract.
// That would have been a second implementation of the game's own arithmetic, and
// it would have been WRONG in the cases that matter: the equipped piece carries
// materia, condition and spiritbond that the sheet row knows nothing about. The
// game publishes its finished numbers in AddonItemDetailCompare's AtkValues, so
// those are what is spoken.
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED, 2026-08-30 (nine hovers in game, logged via the [ItemCmp]
// probe) AND RE-VERIFIED AGAINST THE STRUCT, 2026-09-04 (the field offsets of
// AtkValuesArray.ComparedItem read out of the FFXIVClientStructs.dll in
// DALAMUD_HOME by reflection; every index below is that struct's own byte offset
// divided by 16):
//   - The value array is 349 entries: four 86-value ComparedItem blocks
//     (SelectedItem, SelectedItemOtherQuality, EquippedItem, LeftRing) then five
//     singles ending in CtrlHeld.
//   - EVERY BLOCK CARRIES ITS OWN VALUES, not just the selected one. That is what
//     makes a two-column table possible at all: PrimaryStatValues (33..35) and
//     BonusStats (40..47) exist on the equipped block too, so the right-hand
//     column is READ rather than looked up somewhere else.
//   - Differences are PRE-SIGNED STRINGS in parentheses: "(+25)", "(-12)". The
//     direction is in the text, so MainStatDeltaColorTimelineId - the colour the
//     game paints - is never needed and is deliberately not read.
//   - A difference of ZERO IS OMITTED ENTIRELY rather than written as "(0)".
//     That is why the verdict says "same as equipped" out loud: silence there
//     would be indistinguishable from having no data at all, which for a blind
//     player is the difference between "keep browsing" and "something is broken".
//   - Differences appear ONLY on the selected item; the equipped block and the
//     left-ring block never carry them. The table therefore states the difference
//     as part of the selected side's row and never expects one on the right.
//   - Armour fills two stat slots, weapons three (Delay / Auto-attack /
//     Physical Damage) and only the damage one gets a difference. So the three
//     slots are iterated and empties skipped; nothing about the shape is assumed.
//   - Rings are the only double comparison: LeftRing holds the OTHER hand's ring
//     and ShowRingSlotToggle flips to 1.
//   - Every string arrives finished and in the game's language ("Item Level 27",
//     "Slot: Body", "Gathering +32"), so it is passed through verbatim.
//
// WHY THE TABLE IS A SNAPSHOT and not re-read on every row. The repo's rule is
// "cache references, never values", and this is the case it does not cover: the
// rows are not an announcement waiting to go stale, they are a VIEW OF ONE MOMENT
// that the player opened deliberately on one item, and nothing re-speaks them
// later. Re-reading per row would be worse besides - the window belongs to the
// item under the cursor, and the menu holds the keyboard precisely so that cursor
// cannot move while the table is open.
