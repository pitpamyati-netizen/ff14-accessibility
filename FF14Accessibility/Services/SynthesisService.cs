/// <summary>
/// Reads the running craft (the game's Synthesis window) - the piece a blind
/// player needs to make HQ materials, and the reason Einfg had nothing to be
/// tested against: since patch 6.0 HQ items come from crafting alone, and
/// crafting HQ means filling the quality bar with Touch actions while watching
/// the bars move.
///
/// The window is read through the named fields of FFXIVClientStructs'
/// <c>AddonSynthesis</c> (verified with a reflection probe of the referenced
/// DLL, 2026-09-12): CurrentQuality/MaxQuality, HQPercentage, CurrentProgress/
/// MaxProgress, CurrentDurability/StartingDurability, StepNumber, Condition,
/// ItemName and nine craft-effect slots with name and remaining steps. Nothing
/// is recomputed - every number is the one the game itself displays; in
/// particular the HQ chance is the game's own figure, never a formula of ours.
/// CP comes from the local character's CurrentCp/MaxCp, because the Synthesis
/// addon does not contain that resource. The current step and changed effects
/// are included after actions; a manual read also repeats the condition.
///
/// The user's dump of the window (msg 9367/9365, 2026-09-12) is the proof that
/// these are the numbers on the bars: quality 63 of 80 with 64% HQ, then a fresh
/// craft with 0 of 80, 1%, durability 40, step 1. Fields are used instead of the
/// node ids from that dump, because the typed fields cannot drift with the
/// window layout.
///
/// Announcement: the generic focus reader already speaks a window when the FOCUS
/// moves into it - during a craft the focus never moves (the hands are on the
/// hotbar), so the bars changed in silence. That was the real gap, and this
/// service closes it: it watches the read state and speaks one short line
/// whenever it changes.
