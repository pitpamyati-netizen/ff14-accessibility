/// One place that answers "what is this object called". Before this existed the
/// question was answered four times over (browser, target-change announcement,
/// auto-walk, follow) and each answer differed - the browser resolved gathering
/// nodes properly while the auto-walk said "Unbenannt" for the very same pick
/// (user report 2026-08-08).
///
/// Two things the raw <c>GameObject.Name</c> gets wrong:
///
/// 1. EMPTY for a whole class of objects. Extras, scenery and invisible trigger
///    spots carry no name at all (log 2026-08-06: 25 of 38 nearby EventNpc, all
///    of them untargetable).
/// 2. PRESENT BUT UNSPEAKABLE. EObj 2004123 is literally named "?" in the game
///    data - a screen reader announces nothing usable for it, yet the string is
///    non-empty so every emptiness check waves it through (log 2026-08-06
///    19:49: "?, Objekt, 55 Meter"). Hence <see cref="IsSpeakable"/> asks for a
///    letter or a digit rather than for "not whitespace".
///
/// Where the object itself is silent the game's own sheets are asked, keyed by
/// the object's BaseId. Both links are verified, not assumed:
///  - EventNpc -> ENpcResident: the same lookup NavigationService.NpcPrefix has
///    used for NPC titles all along. Cross-check against a live log
///    (2026-08-08, offline sheet dump): Robyn, Hasthwab, Muriel, Sekka,
///    Gelbjacken-Wache resolved to exactly the name the game spoke.
///  - EventObj -> EObjName: the sheet has the same row count as EObj (15710),
///    and row 2004123 reads "?" - which is precisely the name the game showed
///    live for the object with that BaseId. The row ids line up.
///
/// NOT resolved here, because no source backs the link: BattleNpc (its BaseId
/// addresses BNpcBase, and the name lives in BNpcName under a different id) and
/// Treasure. Those keep the honest fallback instead of a guessed name.
