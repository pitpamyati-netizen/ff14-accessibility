/// <summary>
/// Speaks the Appearance step of character creation.
/// THE PROBLEM: the step is one long list of image grids and sliders. Upstream's
/// answer was a "random appearance" hotkey, which was removed here - it
/// hands a blind player a character they had no say in. User 2026-08-08: *"I (and
/// others) would prefer to be able to make our own character, especially choosing
/// the voice."*
/// HOW IT READS THE STATE - not from the UI. There is no <c>AgentCharaMake</c> and
/// no <c>AddonCharaMakeFeature</c> in this FFXIVClientStructs (verified by
/// enumerating every type in the assembly, 2026-08-08), so there is no struct that
/// holds the in-progress character. What there IS, and what this uses, is the live
/// PREVIEW MODEL: all 32 race/tribe/sex combinations sit in the object table at
/// once and exactly one has <c>DrawObject.IsVisible</c> (verified 2026-07-10,
/// indices 200-231). Its <c>DrawData.CustomizeData</c> is the character being
/// built, and the byte offsets of that struct are ALMOST exactly the
/// <c>Customize</c> column of <c>CharaMakeType.CharaMakeStruct</c> - the sheet and
/// the struct index the same array. So every menu's current value can be read and
/// named.
/// "ALMOST" is doing real work in that sentence, and skipping over it was the
/// 2026-08-08 defect. Two things break the one-menu-one-byte assumption, and both
/// are handled where <see cref="Menu.Byte"/> and <see cref="Menu.Mask"/> are set:
/// three bytes pack a 7-bit value plus an unrelated flag in bit 7, and Iris Size's
/// <c>Customize</c> column names a byte it does not write. See the comments on
/// <see cref="LowSevenBitBytes"/> and <see cref="IrisSizeCustomize"/> - each is
/// backed by the decompiled struct AND by a live log line, because the sheet alone
/// says the wrong thing here.
/// WHY THAT IS THE RIGHT SOURCE: it is independent of how the player navigates.
/// The user reports the creation menus respond to the numpad, i.e. the game moves
/// its own selection; this service only has to notice and describe the result, so
/// it works for mouse, numpad, or anything else the game supports. It also cannot
/// drift out of sync with the model on screen, because it IS the model on screen.
/// WHAT IT WILL NOT DO: it never invents a name. Menus whose entries have no name
/// in the game data (hairstyles, faces, face paint - checked: empty Hint, no
/// HintItem, and the named ones are aesthetician unlocks not offered at creation)
/// are announced as position only. Colours are named from the game's own palette
/// file via <see cref="CharaMakePalette"/>; if that file cannot be read, the
/// announcement silently degrades to the position and says nothing false.
