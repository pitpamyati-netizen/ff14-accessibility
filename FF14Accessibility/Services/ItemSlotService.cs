/// <summary>
/// Answers "which item is in the slot under the cursor" from the GAME'S OWN
/// item-detail agent, not from the icon drawn on the slot.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS: item slots carry no text node, so the name used to come from
/// a reverse lookup of the icon id (InventoryService.ResolveIconItem). An icon
/// does not identify an item. Measured against the shipped Item sheet
/// (game data of 2026-09-04, 52801 rows): 26223 distinct icons carry 50773 named
/// items, and 9198 of those icons are shared by more than one item - 33748 items
/// in total. Wood is the worst corner of the sheet and the one the user hit:
///   icon 22416 = 27 items - Maple Branch, Ash Branch, Willow, Cedar, Elm, Yew, ...
///   icon 22403 = 10 items - Chestnut Log, Teak Log, Larch Log, Red Pine Log, ...
/// Three neighbouring bag slots holding Maple, Ash and Yew Branch therefore all
/// announced "Ash Branch" (log 2026-09-04 16:24, [ItemSlotProbe]), because both
/// icon maps in InventoryService are last-writer-wins per icon. For a blind
/// player that is not cosmetic: it is handing over the wrong item at a turn-in.
///
/// WHAT WAS TRIED FIRST AND IS DISPROVEN - keep it that way. The obvious fix was
/// to take the slot's index in its addon's slot array (AddonInventoryGrid holds
/// 35 AtkComponentDragDrop*) and read that slot out of the inventory container.
/// The probe measured it and it does NOT work: the grid index is a SORTED DISPLAY
/// position, not a container slot, and the view spans every bag at once. Log
/// 2026-09-04 23:25, one focus change with all four bags dumped at that index:
///   grid index 2 showed Sticky Rice   - which really sits in Inventory3 slot 8
///   grid index 3 showed Lalafellin Lentil -                  Inventory2 slot 5
///   grid index 1 showed Buffalo Beans -                      Inventory2 slot 3
/// 41 focus changes, 41 misses, not one container hit. Mapping a display index
/// back to a slot would mean re-implementing the client's sort order, which would
/// go wrong silently the moment the player re-sorts.
///
/// WHAT DOES WORK: AgentItemDetail. It carries the item of the slot the cursor is
/// on (ItemId @312), and - contrary to what the tooltip WINDOW behaviour in
/// TooltipService suggested - it does follow KEYBOARD focus: every probe line
/// read kind=InventoryItem, shown=True. The one catch is timing. At the moment the
/// focus reader runs, the agent still describes the slot the cursor just LEFT; it
/// catches up within a single frame. Measured over 41 focus changes: the read one
/// frame later named the right item every single time, with Index equal to the
/// grid index.
///
/// So the agent is asked, and believed only once it is PROVEN to be about this
/// slot - see <see cref="TryResolve"/>. Until then the caller waits a frame
/// rather than announcing the previous item.
