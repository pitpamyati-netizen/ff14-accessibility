/// Turns a BNpcName sheet row into the name the game actually displays.
///
/// German sheet names leave the adjective ending as a placeholder the game
/// fills in per case ("wuchernd[a] Efeuranke"); read out raw, the brackets end
/// up in the speech - and a name compared raw never matches the one on the
/// object.
///
/// BNpcName.Pronoun is the gender, so the nominative ending follows from it:
/// 0 masculine "-er", 1 feminine "-e", 2 neuter "-es". Two of the three are
/// confirmed against names the game itself displayed - Pronoun 1
/// "wuchernd[a] Efeuranke" shows as "Wuchernde Efeuranke" (window dump
/// 2026-08-17) and Pronoun 0 "rostig[a] Kobalos" as "Rostiger Kobalos" (log
/// 2026-07-19); the neuter form is plain German strong declension.
///
/// The other two placeholders in the sheet, [p] (1195 names) and [t] (201), are
/// dropped without replacement. UNVERIFIED - no displayed name with one of them
/// has been seen yet. Dropping can only cost an ending, never invent a wrong
/// name, which is why it is the safe fallback.
///
/// Only German gets endings: the placeholders are a property of the client
/// language, and guessing suffixes for a language whose rules have not been
/// measured would be worse than the bare stem.
///
/// Lives in its own class because two features read the same sheet: the hunting
/// log (open monsters of the current rank) and the levequest category (the
/// enemies a running battle leve asks for).
///
/// Russian comes from <see cref="RussianMonsterNames"/> instead of the sheet:
/// the sheet is English in this installation (the Rusik translates what is
/// drawn, not what the sheets hold), so the hunting log named a monster
/// "Ixali deftalon" while the same monster's nameplate read "Иксал бронеклюв"
/// (report 2026-09-14, msg 11139). Row 209 was checked against the English
/// sheet: "Ixali deftalon" there, "Иксал бронеклюв" in the Rusik - same id,
/// same monster.
