/// <summary>
/// Spoken descriptions for the character-creation ICON grids.
/// WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST. The icon menus - Gesicht, Frisur, Schwanzform,
/// Fellzeichnung, Ohrenform (Viera) - carry NO name and NO description anywhere in
/// the game data. Base entries have an empty <c>Hint</c> and no <c>HintItem</c>;
/// the only named entries are Friseur-Freischaltungen, which are not offered during
/// creation. So the mod can announce a position and nothing else, and
/// "Gesicht, Typ 3, 3 von 7" tells a blind player where the cursor is and nothing
/// at all about the face.
/// WHERE THE TEXT COMES FROM, and how far it may be trusted:
/// - The entries ARE pictures: 192x192 colour portrait renders under
///   <c>ui/icon/13xxxx/</c>. They were pulled offline with Lumina, composited and
///   looked at, one race/tribe/sex sheet at a time, and described. See
///   <c>docs/charamake-descriptions.md</c> for the extraction pipeline.
/// - **These are MOD-AUTHORED words, not the game's.** The game says nothing here.
///   They are never presented as a quotation of the game, and
///   <see cref="AccessibilityStrings.CharaMakeAuthoredNote"/> is what the Ctrl+F10 summary
///   uses to say so once.
/// - **Structure only, never colour.** The thumbnail is a fixed preview render: its
///   hair and skin are whatever the render used, NOT what the player picked. Hair
///   colour, skin colour and eye colour are their own menus and are described from
///   the real palette by <see cref="ColorNamer"/>. (The earlier note that the icons
///   carry a "blue tint" was wrong - that was a B8G8R8A8/RGBA channel swap in the
///   extraction, corrected 2026-08-08. The no-colour rule stands for the reason
///   above, which is the better one.)
/// - **ONE measured exception, added 2026-08-09 by user decision: a baked ORNAMENT's
///   colour, and only where entries differ by nothing else.** Several rows carry
///   clusters of entries that are the same hair mesh with a differently coloured clip,
///   pin, headband, crown ornament or feather - Lalafell female 133204/133214/133215/
///   133216, Elezen female 132203/132213/132214/132215, Hyur Midlander female
///   131201/131216/131217/131218, Roegadyn male 135003/135014/135015, Miqo'te female
///   134201/134213/134214. These were proven identical the strong way: the ALPHA
///   channel is byte-for-byte equal across the cluster, so the silhouette and geometry
///   are the same and only the ornament's hue moves. The rule's own rationale - "the
///   render's colour is not what the player picked" - does not reach these, because the
///   ornament colour is baked per entry, and without it the entries are indistinguishable
///   to a player who cannot see them while a sighted player picks between them on colour
///   alone. **The colour word is MEASURED, never impressionistic**
///   (tools/charamake-dump + the session's ornament probe: hue/saturation/value over the
///   most saturated pixels of the differing mask). Where saturation is too low to name a
///   hue honestly, brightness is used instead - 133214 is 5 % saturated and is therefore
///   "pale", not "pink", which is what a first pass had called it.
///   NOT VERIFIED, and deliberately not claimed anywhere: whether the game tints these
///   ornaments with the player's hair colour on the 3D model. The icons cannot answer
///   that. The text describes the THUMBNAIL, as all of this file does.
/// - Skin detail IS described - stubble, freckles, lines, tribal markings, scales,
///   fur pattern - because it is proven to belong to the ENTRY and not to a menu
///   that can switch it off: those marks sit in the face's own
///   <c>..._fac_base.tex</c>, checked for Hyur (face 7 carries the stubble),
///   Miqo'te (faces 2-4 carry progressively heavier stripes) and Hrothgar
///   (face 2 tiger stripes, face 3 rosettes). "Facial Features" is a separate menu
///   with its own decals per face and is not what the thumbnails show.
/// SIDES ARE NEVER NAMED - user decision: *"just say one eye, one ear, one hand
/// etc. no need for one/the other, they are indistinguishable."* No description
/// says left or right anywhere.
/// - **Why.** Several type-4 decal slots are the SAME marking mirrored - proven
///   numerically for the Au Ra limbal rings (slots 6 and 7, mirrored-and-aligned
///   MAE 11-20 against 20-37 unmirrored) and true again for the Lalafell ear rings
///   and cheek marks. Which HALF of the face a 192x192 close-up shows cannot be read
///   off the icon reliably: the six race readers disagreed with each other, and the
///   two that refused to call it were the honest ones. A confident wrong side is worse
///   than no side, and the user cannot see the model to catch the error.
/// - **The wording.** A marking that sits on one of a pair of features reads
///   "ein Auge / ein Ohr / eine Wange / eine Braue / einer Gesichtshälfte"
///   ("one eye / one ear / one cheek / one brow / one side of the face").
/// - **Mirrored pairs get the SAME text**, brief and long. Two menu entries that read
///   identically is the honest outcome, not a bug to fix: the entries differ only by a
///   side the mod refuses to guess at.
/// - **The one exception is GEOMETRY, not identity.** A mark that CROSSES the face keeps
///   "von der einen ... zur anderen" / "from one ... to the other", because there the
///   two halves describe the mark's SHAPE and dropping them would lose real information.
/// - Reopening this needs visual confirmation of which half of UV space each decal
///   texture occupies - a measurable fact, and the only route back. Do NOT reintroduce
///   a side from the icon alone.
/// SHARED ENTRIES ARE SHARED DELIBERATELY. Several tribes are drawn from the same
/// faces: Au Ra Raen and Xaela icons are byte-for-byte IDENTICAL, and Lalafell and
/// Roegadyn tribe pairs differ only in the render's skin tone (measured 2026-08-08,
/// under 0.5 % of pixels past a difference of 16). Those ids therefore point at ONE
/// description each, which is why the same text appears against two icon ids.
/// COVERAGE, 2026-08-09. ALL SIX icon menus are COMPLETE:
/// - **Face** - 132/132 icons, all 32 rows.
/// - **Hairstyle** - 879/879 icons over 1,551 slots, all 32 rows.
/// - **Face Paint** - 832/832 real icons, all 32 rows (see NotAnIcon for the 833rd).
/// - **Tail Shape** - 64/64, all 12 rows (Miqo'te, Au Ra, Hrothgar).
/// - **Fur Pattern** - 20/20, all 4 Hrothgar rows.
/// - **Ear Shape (Viera)** - 16/16, all 4 Viera rows.
/// An icon with no entry still returns null and the announcement is byte-identical to
/// what it was, so the null path stays live and is not dead code: it is what a future
/// patch's new hairstyles will hit until they are described.
/// The type-0 menus (Jaw, Eye Shape, Eyebrows, Nose, Mouth, Fang Length, Elezen and
/// Lalafell Ear Shape) have no icon at all and are NOT this table's job - they are
/// shape keys on the face model and want a measurement, not authoring. See

        // both MEASURED off the sheet dump, that decide how this is batched:
        // 1. **The game names none of them.** All 879 CharaMakeCustomize params carry
        //    an EMPTY Hint AND an empty HintItem, and none is IsPurchasable (cmdump
        //    `names Hairstyle`, 2026-08-08). said as much; this checks it per
        //    entry rather than on trust, because a game-supplied name would have to
        //    win over anything authored here. Face Paint is the same: 0 of 833.
        // 2. **The blocks do not overlap AT ALL.** The 32 rows collapse to 18 distinct
        //    icon sets - the two tribes of a race always share their hairstyle list,
        //    except Hyur, where Midlander and Highlander are genuinely different - and
        //    between those 18 sets the intersection is EMPTY. Measured: Hyur Midlander
        //    male's 53 icons appear in no other row. So a finished block covers exactly
        //    its own row(s), and no description can be reused across races.

        // rows. Coverage grew one block at a time because it had to - between the 18
        // sets the intersection is empty, so nothing was ever reusable across races.
        // **Entry order is NOT icon order, and this is the trap that has already bitten
        // this table once.** Entry 13 of Hyur Midlander male is icon 131002; Hrothgar
        // interleaves two runs outright (entry 1 = 137001, entry 2 = 137009, entry 3 =
        // 137002). The batch-2 contact sheets labelled each cell with its ENTRY NUMBER
        // ONLY (mksheet.py), so an author reading them had to map entry -> icon by hand,
        // and a block that assumed "entry k is the k-th icon id" silently attached every
        // description to the wrong picture. The sheets now label cells "<entry> #<iconId>"

        // Batch 3. 833 CharaMakeCustomize params over 32 rows,
        // 27 entries each. Four things were MEASURED off the sheet dump before a
        // word was written, and the last one changes how the rest is batched:
        // 1. **The game names none of them.** All 833 params carry an EMPTY Hint AND
        //    an empty HintItem, and none is IsPurchasable (cmdump `names "Face Paint"`,
        //    re-run 2026-08-09). A game-supplied name would have to beat authored text,
        //    so this is checked per entry rather than taken from the earlier note.
        // 2. **Entry 1 of every row is "no paint" and CANNOT be keyed here.** Its param
        //    is 2401 and CharaMakeCustomize[2401].Icon is 0, so CharaMakeReader stores
        //    icon id 0 for it - and 0 is also what every TYPE-0 menu leaves in its
        //    Icons array. Registering 0 would put this text on every Jaw, Nose, Mouth
        //    and Eye Shape entry in the game. Do not do it. That leaves 26 real icons
        //    per row, 832 in total.
        // 3. **The 32 rows' icon sets are pairwise DISJOINT.** Excluding the shared
        //    "none" param, no icon id is offered by two rows: 32 sets of 26, union 832,
        //    zero intersections. So an id always identifies its row, and a description
        //    has to be registered against every row's id explicitly.
        // 4. **But the DESIGNS repeat.** The same 26 designs appear in the same entry
        //    order in every row looked at so far - the same catalogue rendered on each
        //    race's own face - so ONE string can cover several rows' ids.
        // HOW FAR THAT SHARING IS PROVEN, and where it is only seen:
        //   MEASURED, and safe: Helions against The Lost is 0.00 % of pixels differing
        //     by more than 16, on all 26 entries, per sex - byte-for-byte identical
        //     renders. Same test the Face and Tail batches used.
        //   NOT MEASURABLE, and stated as a VISUAL comparison: male against female
        //     scores 67 %, and Hrothgar against Hyur 82 %, but that is the base render,
        //     not the paint. The control proves the metric cannot answer this question:
        //     two plainly DIFFERENT designs inside one row score 1.6-4.4 %, because the
        //     paint is a few per cent of the pixels. So the claim that Hrothgar male,
        //     Hrothgar female and Hyur Midlander male carry the same 26 designs comes
        //     from looking at all 26 in all three sets, entry by entry, at scale 3 and
        //     at scale 5-7 on the eye and cheek regions. Same footing as the Fur
        //     Pattern sharing, and labelled the same way.
        // NO COLOUR, as everywhere in this file: every one of these renders is red on
        // a fixed preview face. The player picks the colour in its own menu, so only
        // WHERE a mark sits and WHAT SHAPE it has is described.
        // COMPLETE as of 2026-08-09: all 32 rows, 832 ids, against these same 26 strings.
        // The "expected, not measured" caveat that stood here is now DISCHARGED, in two
        // steps that answer two different questions:
        //   MEASURED, per tribe pair: every pair of tribe rows within a race and sex is
        //     byte-for-byte identical on all 26 entries - Elezen, Lalafell, Miqo'te,
        //     Roegadyn, Au Ra and Viera all 0 differing pixels; Hrothgar female differs
        //     on 2 entries by 0.23 %, i.e. antialiasing. The ONE genuine exception is
        //     Hyur, where Midlander and Highlander are different faces - the same split
        //     the Hairstyle menu has. So a tribe pair never needed looking at twice.
        //   LOOKED AT, per remaining block: the 15 distinct race/sex blocks were read
        //     entry by entry against this catalogue, with the confusable groups checked
        //     deliberately (2/3/4 are three different eyeshadows; 17 and 19 are both
        //     broad diagonal bands; 5 vs 6 is edgeless flush vs hard-edged oval). All 15
        //     carry the 26 designs in this order. No deviation was found.

        // as a design: the Miqo'te rows have a dark curved cheek marking present on every
        // entry including the plain one, and the Lalafell rows have a shaded cheek dimple
        // sitting exactly where a cheek design would go.
