/// MEMBERSHIP IS THE GAME'S, END TO END. This class no

/// channel is worth keeping. It asks <see cref="GameChatFilters"/> which of the
/// player's own chat TABS would show the line, archives it into each of those, and
/// speaks it once if any of them has speech switched on.
///
/// What that replaced, and why it had to go: <c>MapCategory</c> was a mod-side
/// bucket-per-chat-type table, and <c>ChatChannels.cs</c> was a mod-side
/// catalogue of sixty-odd channels with its own groups, defaults and switches. Both
/// were second sources of truth for something the game already models per tab, so
/// they answered differently from what the player had configured. The
/// evidence that justified the rewrite - NPC dialogue being dropped - justified the bug
/// report, not the catalogue.
///
/// THREE THINGS ARE STILL DECIDED HERE, and none of them is membership:
///  - HOW a line is worded. Emotes and battle-log lines are already complete
///    sentences that name their own actor, so the "&lt;channel&gt; from
///    &lt;sender&gt;:" wrapper would say the actor twice. The game does not hand over
///    a spoken form, so this stays the mod's job.
///  - Whether a line INTERRUPTS the screen reader or queues behind it.
///  - The NPC dialogue de-duplication, because that is about the mod's own two
///    reading paths, not about the game's filters.
