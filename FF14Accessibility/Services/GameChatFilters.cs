// THE GAME'S OWN CHAT SETTINGS, READ RATHER THAN COPIED.
//
// User, 2026-08-10: *"the mod shouldn't receive every message regardless of filter …
// the mod should be able to follow exact game behavior instead of hacking it in … so
// yes, the mod should exactly follow tabs"*, and the general rule this became in
// CLAUDE.md: if the game already tracks a thing, the mod follows and reads it.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. ChatChannels.cs was a mod-side catalogue of sixty-odd
// channels with its own groups, its own defaults and its own switches. It was a second
// source of truth for something the game already models per TAB, so it answered
// differently from what the player had configured and drifted on every patch. The
// evidence that justified the original bug report did not justify the catalogue.
//
// THE FOUR INPUTS, all measured:
//
//  1. The `LogFilter` sheet is the switch list - one row per checkbox in the game's
//     own chat-log settings. Each row names a `LogKind` plus a Caster and a Target
//     BITMASK over EntityRelationKind. The masks are what make the sheet FINER than
//     the chat type: kind 64 is three separate switches (own / party / others'
//     progression), and the split is data, not string matching.
//  2. Dalamud hands the three fields the masks match against straight over -
//     `IChatMessage.LogKind`, `SourceKind`, `TargetKind` - because `ChatGui` reads
//     them out of the game's own `RaptureLogModule.PrintMessage` call.
//  3. `LogFilterConfig + 0x48 + stride*set + rowId` is one byte per (filter set,
//     filter row): 0 off, 1 on, 2 padding. Mapped by measurement 2026-08-10 and
//     verified against 18 states the game's own window reported, plus a blind decode
//     that reconstructed the player's three tabs correctly.
//  4. `LogTabFilterN` says which set tab N uses; `RaptureLogModule.ChatTabs[N].Name`
//     is the tab's own name, and an EMPTY name is how a tab says it does not exist
//     (probe 2026-08-10: tabs 0-2 named General/Battle/Event, tabs 3-4 empty, and
//     `AddonChatLog.TabCount` read 3).
//
// NOTHING HERE IS HARDCODED THAT THE GAME CAN STATE. The 307-byte stride is the
// sheet's id space (highest row id + 1), the slot count is
// `(sizeof(LogFilterConfig) - 0x48) / stride`, and the padding positions are derived
// from the sheet as well - a position is padding when no row has that id, or the row
// there has no name. Square Enix added Cross-world Linkshell 2-8 at ids 300-306 years
// after the rest; deriving the constants is what makes the next such addition
// FOLLOWED instead of mis-read.
//
// READ-ONLY, and it has to stay that way. Nothing in this file writes a game setting
// or calls a game function. The game's settings window is the only route to changing a
// filter - no slash command toggles one - and making that window readable was
// the other half of this work.
